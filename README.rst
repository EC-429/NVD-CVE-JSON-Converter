This tool was create to make it easy to download/convert/export/use the standard NVD CVE JSON data feed. Unfortunately the JSON blob is massive and cannot be easily interpretted/parse by most SIEM/SOC tools and therefore convertering it in to a flat file with only key metrics per CVE is very useful. This flat file can be more easily ingested in to everyday Analyst tool-sets.

Instructions
======================================================
- Download NVD CVE JSON data feed (link above)
- Clone, or copy, the python file to your machine
- Run python script in same directory as JSON file
- Flat file is output to working directory

Enjoy ðŸ™‚
